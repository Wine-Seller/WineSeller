The Coravin System is a transformational new technology that allows users to pour wine whiling keeping the cork in the bottle, where it has been since it was ﬁrst sealed in the winery. Now you can enjoy your favorite and ﬁnest wines by the glass whenever you like, and feel conﬁdent that your wine will be protected until the next glass is poured. Now you can share and enjoy the same bottle, or bottles on multiple occasions, over weeks, months, or even longer - without wasting a drop. How do we do it? When the Coravin System is put in place, a thin, hollow needle is inserted through the cork to extract the wine. The bottle is then pressurized with argon, an inert gas that is in the air we breathe. Once the bottle has been pressurized, the wine flows through the needle and pours into your glass. Once your wine is poured, the needle is removed, and the cork reseals itself.',
